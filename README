A simple little script I wrote to help the Delphi developers with
understanding the GeoPlace transfer mechanism: gets an XML file
for the last 60 days from GeoPlace, and then forwards that file to the 
user's browser for downloading.

If this is something you would find useful, help yourself to a copy.
